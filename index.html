        <div class="subheading mb-5">Data Science & Finance</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kyle Nguyen, I am currently attending University of California, Irvine as a second year. I am a hard working person that is seeking for careers around Riverside hoping to develop my work skills.  I am passionate of data science, business services, finances, and to develop effectient teamwork and communication. with my Leadership skills, I learned to be a key club president at my high school that gains my leadership skills from anywhere I claimed and earned. Because of that, As a Key Club President, I lead my own club, Delegate tasks to Key Club Officers, and provide students with community service opportunities. I volunteered at 30+ events annually and received 80+ hours.  and created a great positive impact through one of my efforts at school. An example of the leadership roles I have is being Key Club President for my school and being a representative. Key Club is an international private organization that is a dedicated club that offers high school students to aim for service opportunities, leadership, character, and caring through the environment. Another leadership I held is I'm a Club President/Founder of the First Generation Scholars Club. What I learned about the club is seeing the admissions for colleges and finding a better path for college. This club will help me gain admission to college because I'm first gen. First Gens are students the first ones in their family who will attend a 4-year college.  I am a first-generation high school student who works hard because my parents have shaped me into the person that I am today. My parents were refugees from Vietnam and they traveled to California by boat which was hard for them. My mom found work at a nail salon and my dad was in construction. Their sacrifices paved the way for me, my brother, and my sister to have a better life in California.

My parents were born in Vietnam in the 1970s and because it was impossible to find jobs or buy a home, they moved to California to have a better life for themselves and their future family. Since I grew up in a culture different from mine, I have more expectations placed on me. My parents have taught me to pursue a higher education through good schools. When I first came to school, I was unable to speak English and had a hard time learning because my parents only spoke to me in Vietnamese. I was placed in an ESL class which helped me learn English and finally be able to communicate with my peers. Soon I became my parent's translator. I had to explain to my parents what was happening at school and had to translate whenever the landlord or banks called. This taught me how to be patient and resourceful not because I wanted to but because I had to.

In my senior year of high school, I reached out to a program called First Generation Scholars which helps students get a higher education for colleges. I started a chapter of First Gen Scholars and through mentorship learned about the college admissions process. I learned about the financial aid process and am teaching other club members about it. Because my parents don't know anything about the application process, this club has given me so much support and guidance. I hope to share this information with others and go to a career path in where I will learn, grow, and achieve my goal.<br><br>
